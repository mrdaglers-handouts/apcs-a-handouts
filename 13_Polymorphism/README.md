## Unit 13: Polymorphism
The word _polymorphism_ means "having many forms." It comes from the Greek root words _poly_ (many) and _morph_ (form). There are two types of _polymorphism_: _Method Overloading_ is where _Java_ knows which method to use when the code compiles. This is called _compile time polymorphism_ or _static binding_. _Method Overriding_ is where _Java_ knows which method to use during run-time. This is called _dynamic binding_.
