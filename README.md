## AP Computer Science A - Student Handouts

Welcome to AP Computer Science A. Here you will find all the handouts you will need. This course introduces students to computer science with fundamental topics which includes problem-solving, design strategies and methodologies, data structures, approaches to processing data (algorithms), analysis of potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing. These techniques represent proven approaches for developing solutions that can scale up from small, simple problems to large, complex problems. This course's curriculum is compatible with many CS1 courses in colleges and universities. Here is the [class syllabus](./syllabus_apcs_a.pdf).
