## Unit 7: Searching and Sorting Algorithms
Searching and sorting algorithms are a great review of arrays and iteration. In this unit, you will learn the two main searching algorithms \[Linear Search and Binary Search\] as well as two of the many sorting algorithms \[Selection Sort and Insertion Sort\]. We looked at all of these algorithms last year in ECS, and this year you are going to understand their code.

Selection Sort and Insertion Sort are slower algorithms for sorting large amounts of data that are completely unsorted. You will be learning Merge Sort in our recursion unit this year which is a much faster algorithm for sorting a large set of random data. Keep in mind that Selection Sort and Insertion Sort can be the quicker of the algorithms for data this is close to sorted.
