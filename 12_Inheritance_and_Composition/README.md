## Unit 12: Inheritance and Composition
Inheritance is when a Class inherits the features (fields and methods) of another class. This is a great way to reuse code and can be done for any _is-a_ relationship. The class whose features are inherited is called the super-class and the one that inherits its features is called the sub-class. Another way to reuse code in _OOP_ is using composition. Composition is a _has-a_ relationship and one class will be a _field_ of another class.
