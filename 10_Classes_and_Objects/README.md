## Unit 10: Classes and Objects
An _object_ is a bundle of variables and related methods. A _class_ is a blueprint for _object(s)_. When you create an _object_ from a _class_, you are said to take an instance of it. _Object oriented programming_ (_OOP_) is programming that uses objects and classes.
