## Unit 2: Control Flow / Selections
In this unit, you will learn about control flow/selections which allows a programmer to choose actions with alternative courses. Selection statements use Boolean values to make their decisions. Since we are learning Boolean values, we will also be studying Boolean operators and De Morgan's law.
