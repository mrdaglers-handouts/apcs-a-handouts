## Unit 1: Setup, Intro to Java, and Error Types
In this unit, we will set up a computer to develop and run Java programs using an advanced text editor and the command line interface. While creating our first program, we look at the importance of adding comments to your code and going over the three types of programming errors. We will end this unit by writing programs to solve problems. Through these problems, you will learn elementary programming using privative data types, variables, constants, operators, expressions, and input / output.
