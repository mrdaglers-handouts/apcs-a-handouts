## Unit 11: Recursion
_Recursion_ in computer science is a method of solving a problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. The signature of recursion is when a function calls itself and an exit point called the _base case_. _Merge Sort_ is a sorting algorithm that uses _recursion_ and can be much faster than the other _recursive methods_ we studied in this class.
